## But why?

Wanted to learn the Rust language for a bit, so decided to read [*The Rust Programming Language*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), written by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, with contributions from the Rust Community. This repo contains the code developed while reading the book.

## But how (do I use it)?

Each chapter's exercises and code are stored in its own directory.

### Dependencies

How to install dependencies (if any).

### Running

## But what?

Features implemented in the project.

## But how (does it work)?

Any details on implementation and how does it work behind the scenes.
